## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains a full experimental framework for comparing **FedAvg** and **Fed-PLT** algorithms in Federated Learning under different practical scenarios:

- Varying local epochs \( N_e \)
- Communication quantization
- Stochastic gradients (mini-batch sizes)
- Logistic regression on synthetic classification tasks
- Evaluation of both **optimality convergence** and **classification accuracy**

The codebase allows reproducible experiments and exports TikZ-compatible `.dat` files for direct integration into LaTeX papers.

## üìä Algorithms Implemented

- **FedAvg** ([McMahan et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629))  
- **Fed-PLT** ([Bastianello et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03849))

Both algorithms are implemented following their original formulations, with configurable local training epochs, quantization levels, and batch sizes.

## üöÄ Running the Experiments

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The only major dependencies are:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scienceplots

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run full simulation pipeline:
Simply execute:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
* Generate synthetic classification data
* Run all algorithm under different conditions
* Export both .pdf plots and .dat files

  ## üìÑ Report
This project has been used to produce the full simulation results and plots for the final academic report:
